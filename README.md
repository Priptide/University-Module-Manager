# University-Module-Manager
This was a project for University in Java to create a system to manage university modules

Used primarily for testing does show a decent usage of a csv import system.

Also allows features for sorting the data aswell as the ability to expand if needed to do greater sorting of the students and their respective modules.

Although there is little functionality feel free to use this as you see fit to make any tool you may want, just submit a pull request if you want to know any extra information or would like to ask any questions on the project!
